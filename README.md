# Is Climate Change a Big Deal?
The number of days that hit 90 degrees in Miami each year, along with a trailing ten year average:

How to demonstrate the currently observable effects of climate change is something I've thought a good deal about. Climate models are frequently necessarily opaque: the climate is an enormously complicated system so any rigorous attempt to forecast the climate into the future will need to be complicated itself. So complicated are the weather and global climate that they are the [archetypal example of chaos theory at work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). Given our computational limits, climate forecasts come with wide error bars, which historically has contributed to the difficulty climate scientists have had in getting sufficient public acknowledgement of the dangers of climate change. NASA scientist James Hansen famously testified in 1988 that the effects of climate change were already apparent, "It's happening now", he said, sparking some alarm. When the actual pace of warming over the following decade seemed slower than the worst climate models had predicted (and when warming seemed to ['pause' for a time starting in the late 90's](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2014/03/06/who-pressed-the-pause-button)) some skeptics declared that warming had never been an issue to begin with.

Looking back from our 2019 vantage point, however, the trend has become undeniable and clearly observable. Why is action still stifled by climate skepticism? I hope to help clarify what is happening around us with easy to parse visualizations that don't require complicated climate models to evaluate: Are summers hotter now than they used to be? Have daily highs gone up or down in the last decade? I documented my first foray into this (along with a longer discussion of my motivation and methods) in a [blog post](https://medium.com/@max.samuel.miller/is-climate-change-a-big-deal-a-case-study-for-practical-data-science-28700eafaa0a). This repository represents the continuation of the project, to encompass more visualizations representing more cities and hosted as an interactive site.

The first step is data collection, from the NOAA API, a process which is a little cumbersome given the NOAA API's limits. The basic outline of this is in the first big_deal notebook, though the actual data collection I performed from a python file at the command line rather than out of a notebook.

This has also been an exercise in creating visualizations. Plotly is syntactically simple (compared to matplotlib, that doesn't say much) and produces attractive, interactive visualizations right out of the gate. I've also begun using Dash to create an interactive dashboard. With multiple cities worth of data requested from NOAA, the dashboard allows a user to select a city and a metric to view (average daily maximum temperature, average daily minimum temperature number of days above 90 each year) to generate a chart. I then added a div in the page to display the results of a t-test performed on the average of the metric for the last 10 years relative to the last half of the 20th century. Aesthetic adjustments to follow, but I'm pretty happy with the early results:

I've also added dynamically changing backgrounds with each city, although it's a little wonky getting those to align properly.

The final dashboard with all 86 cities is now live at [isclimatechangeabigdeal.com](isclimatechangeabigdeal.com). A little bit more about some of the trends I saw in the data as I put the site together is discussed in a [follow up blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-climate-change-65ea422cf2dd). For any one looking for the short answer as to whether climate change is a big deal - I think the answer is yes.
